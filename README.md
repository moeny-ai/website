GitHub wouldn't let us obtain the dormant username moeny as per their still posted Name Squatting Policy.

Thank you for your request. It appears that you are asking about releasing a dormant or inactive username. We no longer review requests to release dormant or inactive usernames. You can view our Username Policy here:
